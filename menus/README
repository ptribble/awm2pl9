Menus panes are now redrawn differently. Rather than waiting for
a "side-effect" expose from a copy area, trackmenu() just draws them
itself. This should result in substantially better behaviour on colour
systems. A number of nits have been cleaned up as well.

RTLMenus Version 1.0 Release 2.1

This menu package was written at Siemens Research and
Technologies Laboratory, Princeton, NJ, in the second half 
kof 1987.

The original basis for the source file menu.c was the menu
package for version X10/6.6 of xterm (misc.c).  We thank the
programmers who gave us this basis from which to expand.

We wrote this package to meet the needs of the RTL Tiled
Windows window manager which is under development here.
We have simulated much of the functionality of the SunWindows
Toolkit menus.  The package has been tested only on Suns.
We welcome enhancements and changes, and we would appreciate
hearing about them.  We'll be glad to accept bug reports, but
we can't support this package beyond our own needs.  We are
making it available because you 1) may be able to use it,
and 2) may learn some tricks from it.

We found the DBUG C Program Debugging Package by Fred Fish to
be useful in debugging track_menu.c.  The DBUG macros remain,
so you can use them to trace the code if you have DBUG
available.  The Makefile assumes you do NOT have DBUG, and
turns it off. 

Adam J. Richter of UC Berkeley wrote an initial version of the
menus while he was here last summer.  Joe Camaratta and Mike
Berman designed and built the present version.  This work was
performed with the guidance of Ellis Cohen and the assistance
of Mark Biggers.

We thank those who beta-tested the menus; in particular,
thanks to George Sherouse and Mark Baushke for their useful
suggestions.
