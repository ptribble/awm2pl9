Here are a few contributed bitmaps (as well as some of my own) that
might be useful to people designing interfaces with awm. As noted
in the man page, care should be taken when constructing menu panes
with these as they are not all the same size. Your contributions
to this collections are welcomed.

It should be noted that hackers don't usually make very good artists.
If someone more artistically inclined (and willing to work within the
limits of a 16x16 or 32x32 frame) is interested in adding to this
collection, please do!
